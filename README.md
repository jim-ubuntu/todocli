This is a very basic To do list app for the CLI. 

Just an exercise in my python skills. I also enjoy using it on both of my computers. 
Ideas continue to come to me as to how I can alter the interface as well as implementing other
features. So I have made this repo to track the applications evolution. 

It's just a simple app, but it's nice to see something come together. 

A stepping stone to bigger things. :]
